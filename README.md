# Welcome to my Travel Memories Project Tutorial

## Motivation:
I decided to create this app to visiualize my memories of the travel destinations I have visited.

## Setup
1. Create a new github repository.
2. Clone the repository into your local machine 


## Project Structure
1. Open the travel app repo into your local machine. ( I use Vscode )
2. Create two new folder; one for the backend and one for the frontend of the application
3. Open us the terminal and run **npm init -y** I assume you already have npm setup 
    - running this command initializes a json filoe into our root directory and helps us when deploying the application later. the json file will hold the dependencies
4. run **npm install express mongoose dotenv** 

### Backend Structure
1. In the backedn folder, we create an server.js file which is going to be the main entry point of our API.
2. Import express and create an express application
    - '''import express from 'express';''' -> To use this syntax we need to add the type: module filed in the json file.
